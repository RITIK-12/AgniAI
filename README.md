## Project Overview
AgniAI leverages advanced Visual AI technologies to provide precise and timely monitoring of wildfires using satellite imagery. This project aims to harness the power of the latest YOLOv8 model, fine-tuned to identify and track the progression of wildfires from space, offering a crucial tool for emergency response teams and environmental monitoring agencies.

## Dataset Used
For this project, the **Satellite Wildfire Detection Dataset** provided by HTW Berlin on Roboflow was utilized. This dataset is a collection of annotated satellite images designed specifically for training models to detect wildfires. The images in this dataset are diverse, covering various landscapes and wildfire scenarios, which helps in building a robust model. Data augmentation techniques such as flips and brightness adjustments (Â±15%) were applied to enhance the model's ability to generalize across different lighting and orientations.

## Model and Training
The YOLOv8 model, known for its speed and accuracy in object detection tasks, was chosen for this project. The model was fine-tuned for 10 epochs on the Satellite Wildfire Detection Dataset to adapt its detection capabilities to the unique characteristics of wildfire in satellite imagery.

- **Model:** YOLOv8
- **Epochs:** 10
- **Optimizations:** Adjustments were made to the learning rate and augmentation strategies to optimize performance for high-resolution satellite images.
